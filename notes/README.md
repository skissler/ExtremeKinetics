A few things I want to accomplish here: 

* Figure out how variable infectiousness periods are in the NBA study, assuming some kind of simple threshold model. 
* Figure out how this relates to PCR detectability -- e.g., set infectiousness at Ct=25, detectability at Ct=40. How quickly do we reach infectiousness?
